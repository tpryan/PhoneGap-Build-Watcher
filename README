An application for watching PhoneGap Build apps during development. To take a few clicks out of the development process.


The core application is meant to be built in PhoneGap, or PhoneGap Build. 


An optional part of the ANT build process relies on Transporter Chief, which is available here:

Basically in development with the ANT script and transporter Chief you have the option of pushing
new content to PGB, waiting for it to build, downloading new app, and installing it on an attached 
iOS device. 

An optional part of the ANT build process relies on the Android SDK

Basically in development with the ANT script and the SDK tool ADB you have the option of pushing
new content to PGB, waiting for it to build, downloading new app, and installing it on an attached 
Android device.
